<h2><span class="smcap">To Women Editors</span>.</h2>

<p>In appreciation of the many favorable press notices and high editorial
comment given to my previous efforts in the compilation of books on
suggestions for entertaining and in the publication of my magazine,
<i>What To Eat</i>, this book on "Breakfasts and Teas," is inscribed. Full
well I realize the difficulties under which most Women Editors labor in
their duty of suggesting new ideas for entertaining, and I hold a
sincere appreciation for the good they perform in elevating the women of
our country to a higher plain of civilization. When the woman is done
with the school room and finds herself in the social whirl it is then
she begins to see that she has another and very important course of
learning to acquire and forthwith she submits herself to the tutorage of
the editor of the woman's page. No school teacher of the world has such
a large class to instruct as this woman editor. Her pupils are numbered
by the thousands and tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands. The
knowledge she must impart is not of the kind that has been set down by
past generations and which once learned suffices as a supply for all
future dispensations. It is a knowledge of the day, which is constantly
changing and which must be gleaned each day for the lessons of the
morrow. This little book embraces the latest information on the title it
bears, and all herein contained, that may be of help to the woman
editor, she is welcome to use if she will comply with the publisher's
rule of giving the proper credit to the volume.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Publisher's Announcement</span>.</h2>

<p>"Breakfast and Teas" is a companion book to that most interesting and
helpful series of social works compiled by Paul Pierce, publisher of
<i>What To Eat</i>, the National Food Magazine, and the world's authority on
all problems pertaining to the drawing room and the table. The other
books are "Dinners and Luncheons," "Parties and Entertainments,"
"Suppers," and "Weddings and Wedding Celebrations." The contents of each

olume are selected with especial regard for the extent of their
helpfulness for the perplexed hostess. The instructions that are given
will afford suggestions for all the different kinds of social functions
the host or hostess ever will have occasion to give or to attend, and
therefore all the volumes combined will furnish a veritable library for
the person who entertains or who attends entertainments, and no person
with a regard for correct social forms should fail to be supplied with
all five of the books. In the directions special attention is given to
the suggestions afforded for other kinds of entertainments, so that in
each entertainment described the reader will find ideas for a dozen or
more entertainments of a similar nature.</p>

<h3>A VERY SWELL REPAST FOR A SWAGGER SET.</h3>

<p>By the operation of one of those laws of occult force, the power of
which we feel while we are totally ignorant of its rules, we fix upon
the noonday as the time for some of our chief social functions.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact we are at our best at this time of the day, both
physically and mentally; and we naturally choose it for our special
entertainments and enjoyments.</p>

<p>One of the chief of these is the noonday breakfast, which meets several
social demands. It is the proper service for the return of nearly every
obligation in the form of hospitality which may have been received by
the giver during the closing season.</p>

<p>This noonday breakfast very much resembles the morning breakfast of the
French country-house in the variety of foods. This repast always is most
attractive to an American because of its informality, and the viands are
enticing. This morning breakfast of the Parisian is really like a little
dinner, and that is what we wish to serve to meet all the varied
obligations that are to be wiped out by an artistic and choice return
entertainment, whether it be called luncheon or noonday breakfast.</p>

<p>When a luncheon or noonday breakfast by formal invitation is given, the
service is identical with that of dinner <i>a la Russe</i>, and the bill of
fare similar, although<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> less extended; but the pleasantest repasts are
those where perfect service is secured without formality.</p>

<p>First, the table: Lay it as carefully as for dinner and in much the same
way, save that an embroidered or delicately colored cloth may replace
the white dinner linen; under this cloth lay the usual thick one of felt
or Canton flannel. The small dessert and fruit, flowers and relishes,
may form a part of the table decoration. Now that castors are seldom
used, unless of fine old silver and ornamental form, place conveniently
about the table salt, pepper, the oil and vinegar stand, and the table
sauces in their original bottles set in silver holders. Olives, salted
almonds, cheese-straws and sandwiches may be put upon the table in
pretty china, silver and glass ornamental dishes; in short, all save the
hot dishes may form part of the ornamentation. Hot plates are required
for all the food except the raw shell-fish, salad and dessert, and
should be ready for immediate use, together with a reserve of silver, or
means for washing it. The coffee service may be laid before the hostess
or upon the side table, at convenience; chocolate is similarly served,
and is a favorite breakfast beverage, especially when it is made with
eggs, after the Mexican method.</p>

<p>Tea is not on the regulation breakfast list, but of course it may be
served if it is desired. Cider, malt liquors, the lighter wines, and in
summer the various "cups" or fruit punches are in order; the breakfast
wines are sherry, hock or Rhine wine, sauterne and champagne; and when a
variety is served the preference<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> of each guest is ascertained by the
attendant before filling the glasses.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Breakfast Menu</span>.</h3>

<p>The following is an excellent bill of fare for a noonday breakfast:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Little Neck Clams</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Cold Wine Soup</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Angels on Horseback</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Chicken Patties</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Newberg Lobster</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Green Peas with New Turnips</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Grape Fruit Sherbet</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Broiled Birds with Orange Salad</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>White Custards</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Cannelons with Jelly</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Strawberries in Cream</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Black Coffee</i></p>

<p>For a simple repast for a few persons, two relishes may be omitted, only
one <i>entree</i> being served; then the sherbet, the birds, and one desert,
with coffee; this combination would make a most acceptable small
breakfast.</p>

<p>Blue Point Oysters, as all small oysters are called, may be used in
their season, in place of the clams. Both are of much dietetic value,
the clams being the most stimulating and nutritious, and the oysters the
most tonic and digestible.</p>

<p>The cold wine soup is a valuable tonic nutrient; and each dish possesses
some special value of its own.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cold Wine Soup</span>.</h3>

<p>Wash quarter of a pound of fine sago in cold water, put it over the fire
in two quarts of cold water, and boil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> it gently until the grains are
transparent; then dissolve with it half a pound of fine sugar, add a
very little grated nutmeg, a dust of cayenne, and an even teaspoonful of
salt; when the sugar is melted add a bottle of claret, and as much cold
water as is required to make the soup of an agreeable creamy
consistency; cool it before serving.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Angels on Horseback</span>.</h3>

<p>This is one of the gastronomic inspirations of Urbain Dubois, the <i>chef</i>
of the great Emperor of Germany. Remove all bits of shell from fine
oysters and lay them upon a clean towel; cut as many slices of thin
bacon, about the size of the oysters; run them alternately upon bright
metal skewers, dust them with cayenne, lay the skewers between the bars
of a double-wire grid-iron, and broil the "angels" over a quick fire
until the bacon begins to crisp; then transfer the skewers to a hot dish
garnished with lemon and parsley, or with cresses, and send at once to
table. In serving, a skewerful of "angels" is laid upon a hot plate, and
the eater removes them with a fork. The success of this dish depends
upon the rapidity with which it is cooked and served.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Patties</span>.</h3>

<p>The housewife is advised to procure the cooked patty cases at the
baker's shops, ready to be heated and filled with the following
<i>ragout</i>. For a dozen patties remove the bones and skin from a pint
bowlful of the white meat of cold boiled or roasted chicken, and cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> it
into one-half inch pieces. Open a can of mushrooms, save the liquor, and
cut the mushrooms about the size of the chicken; put over the fire in a
saucepan a tablespoonful each of butter and flour, stir them until they
are smoothly blended; then gradually stir in the mushroom liquor and
enough milk to make a sauce which should be as thick as cream after it
has boiled; add the chicken and mushrooms, a palatable seasoning of salt
and pepper; place the saucepan in a pan containing boiling salted water
and keep hot until it is time to fill the hot patty cases and serve
them.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Green Peas with New Turnips</span>.</h3>

<p>Peal about a dozen new turnips of medium size, boil them until tender in
salted boiling water; meanwhile smoothly mix in a saucepan a
tablespoonful each of butter and flour, and gradually stir in a pint of
milk. Open a can of French peas, drain them, run cold water through
them, draining again, and heat them in the sauce, seasoning them
palatably with salt and white pepper. When the turnips are tender scoop
a hollow in the center of each, fill it with peas, and arrange them upon
the rest of the peas on a hot shallow dish.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Typical Breakfast Menu</span>.</h3>

<p>Here is a typical breakfast menu: Grape fruit, plain or prepared by
removing the center and putting in it a spoonful of rum and a lump of
sugar; some cereal with cream or fruit; a chafing dish preparation,
oysters in some way, mushrooms, or eggs, or a mixture on toast;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> hot
bread of some kind, waffles, corn cakes, pancakes, flannel cakes, etc.;
coffee and coffee cake.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Breakfast Decorations</span>.</h3>

<p>The sunburst done in one color is a very popular design for summer
hostesses. Suppose one is giving a pond lily breakfast. In the center of
the table have a cut glass bowl of the lilies. From beneath the bowl
radiate long streamers of pale green ribbon ending at the plates of the
guests with name cards decorated with the lilies cut out of watercolor
paper. Half way between the bowl and the plate, the ribbon is knotted
about a bouquet of the flowers or a bunch of maidenhair ferns which will
become the corsage bouquet of the guest. Sometimes several strands of
narrower ribbon are used giving more rays; a very pretty effect. Do not
have artificial light at a summer breakfast. Garden flowers are all the
rage, either one kind or several kinds mixed. Coreopsis, mignonette,
featherfew, nasturtiums, lilies, sweet peas, geraniums, all the simple
garden flowers are used now in place of the hothouse products.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Breakfast to Bride-Elect</span>.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">To a Bride</span>.</h4>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 23em;">Happy is the bride whom the sun shines on,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 24em;">And happy today are you;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 23em;">May all of the glad dreams you have dreamed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 24em;">In all of your life come true;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 23em;">May every good there is in life</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 24em;">Step down from the years to you.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 23em;">There's nothing so sweet as a maid is sweet,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 24em;">On the day she becomes a bride;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 23em;">Oh, the paths that ope to the dancing feet!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 24em;">Oh, the true love by her side!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 23em;">Oh, the gray old world looks a glad old world,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 24em;">And it's fields of pleasure, wide.</span><br />
</p>

<p>A breakfast for a bride-elect can be made very dainty and pretty by
following out a pink color scheme, unless one prefers the more common
scheme of white. Cover the table with the prettiest, whitest damask, and
over this lay lace-trimmed or openwork doilies, with a foundation of
pink satin underneath. For flowers have pink begonias (very pretty and
effective), carnations, roses, azaleas or cyclamens. Arrange the flowers
in a center basket with a large pink butterfly bow on the handle. Light
the table with pink candles and shades in silver or china candlesticks.
Have the place cards in heart shapes with pen and ink sketches or
watercolors of brides, or tiny cupids.</p>

<p>Mark the bride-elect's chair by a large bow of ribbon or a bouquet of
pink flowers matching those on the table. If white flowers are used,
lilies of the valley and hyacinths make a pretty bouquet, tied with
white gauze ribbon.</p>

<p>Serve this menu:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Grape Fruit with Rum and Cherries</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Turkey Cutlets</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Stuffed Peppers (Serve on Heart-Shaped Pieces of Bread)</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Coffee</i></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>A tiny bouquet of violets tied with gauze ribbon at each plate makes the
table pretty and is a dainty souvenir for the guest. Sometimes the
individual favors are tiny wicker hampers filled with fine flowers tied
with white silk cord.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">For the Bride-Elect</span>.</h3>

<p>A white breakfast is the daintiest and prettiest for the bride-elect.
Have the table decorations in white. For the center have a large round
basket of bride roses, and at each plate tiny French baskets filled with
maidenhair fern and white pansies, or apple blossoms, for individual
favors. Tie the handle of each basket with white gauze ribbon, looping
the baskets together with the ribbon forming a garland for the table.
Serve strawberries in large white tulips or bride roses, and have the
ices in form of wedding bells. For name cards have two wedding bells
tied with white satin ribbons.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Silver Wedding Day Breakfast</span>.</h3>

<p>For the breakfast the table is crossed by a broad band of white
carnations, sprinkled with diamond dust. Arranged in billows over the
table is silver gauze, silver candelabra, and all the handsome silver,
which the hostess possesses. The menu is:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Bouillon</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Lobster Cutlets</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Tartar Sauce</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Cucumber Sandwiches</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Breast of Turkey, larded and broiled</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Green Peas</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Current Jelly</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Hot Rolls</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Pear and Celery Salad, with German Cherries served in Hearts of Lettuce</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Caramel Ice Cream, with Pecan Meringue</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Old Madeira is served with the meat course, then Sauterne.</i></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Family Breakfast</span>.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Grape Fruit with Cherries and Pineapple</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Creamed Fish</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>New Potatoes with Sauce of Parsley and Drawn Butter</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Sliced Cucumbers</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Hot Biscuits</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Fried Chicken</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Coffee</i></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Light Informal Breakfast</span>.</h3>

<p>First serve a fluffy egg omelet with Saratoga potatoes, and fish and
cheese sandwiches cut in hearts and rings. Next cucumber boats filled
with cucumber and tomato salad mixed with sour cream dressing, resting
on lettuce leaves. With this an innovation in the shape of square ginger
wafers. Place by each plate salted almonds and bread and butter on bread
and butter plates. The last course is a popular New England combination,
warm apple sauce and huckleberry muffins. Tea is the beverage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Two Bon Voyage Breakfasts</span>.</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 23em;">"I take my leave of you</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 23em;">Shall not be long but I'll be here again."</span><br />
</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Use the national colors for decorations for a bon voyage breakfast. This
will remind the guest of honor that "East, West, Hame's Best." Use blue
and white hyacinths and red tulips, carnations or roses and tiny silk
flags can be used for place cards. Carry out the same idea in the ices,
candies, etc. One pretty floral decoration for a bon voyage breakfast is
a ship and the place cards can have a tiny ocean steamer for decoration.
Ask each guest to bring some little gift. Tie these with tissue paper
and baby ribbon, leaving a long end of the ribbon. Make a little bag of
flowered chintz or silk and place the gifts inside. Have cards labeled
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc., one for each day of the voyage. Slip
the end of the ribbon through a card and leave the labeled ends of the
ribbons sticking out of the top of the bag. This will give a little
remembrance for each day on shipboard, a very pleasant remembrance too.
A packet of ship letters each labeled a certain day, is another gift
much prized by travelers.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Have three tables, with six guests at a table with La France roses for
decorations, and silver for all the courses laid at each cover.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>The guest cards are little circular marine water color sketches, no two
alike. The menu is as follows:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Grape Fruit with strawberries</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Salmon Croquettes</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Fried Mush</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Jelly</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Steamed Chicken</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Hot Rolls</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Shoestring Potatoes</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Coffee</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Vegetable Salad</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Wafers with Melted Cheese</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Molded Cherry Jelly with English Walnuts, served with Whipped Cream</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Sponge Cakes</i></p>

<p>The grape fruit is served in halves with one large strawberry in the
center of the fruit. The salmon croquettes are molded in pyramidal form,
a bit of cress laid on the top, and the mush which has been made the
night before is cut in cubes an inch square, dipped in eggs and cracker
dust, then dropped in deep fat, the only way to fry mush a delicate
brown and preserve its softness. A spoonful of current jelly completes a
color scheme.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Steamed Chicken</span>.</h3>

<p>Grind with a food chopper the meat of two raw chickens and half a pound
of pickled pork. Add a cup of sifted bread crumbs, half a cup of thick
sweet cream, half a cup of butter, half a can of chopped mushrooms, a
little minced parsley, salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly with the hands
and put into well greased timbale cups and steam three hours.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sauce</span>.</h3>

<p>Make a sauce for this by mixing the liquor of the mushrooms, half a cup
of cream, the rest of the mushrooms,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> chopped; heat and thicken with
half a cup of cracker dust. Serve very hot.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Vegetable Salad</span>.</h3>

<p>With the smallest sized potato scoop, cut out a pint of potato balls
about the size of common marbles and boil in salted water until tender.
Let them cool, and add a pint of the largest peas, three stalks of
minced celery, a good sized cucumber cut fine, ten drops of onion juice.
Salt and pepper any good cooked dressing, to which add two large
spoonfuls of thick cream and two of olive oil. Serve on a lettuce leaf,
pour over the dressing, and last of all put on the top of the salad
three little balls of red pickled beet cut with the potato scoop, and
half embedded in the dressing.</p>

<p>Make a gelatine jelly, flavored with juice of two lemons and cherries.
Serve with whipped cream, into which beat finely sifted crumbs of three
macaroons.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Who Takes the Cake</span>?</h3>

<p>"Who takes the cake?" is a most merry-making scheme to assist in
entertaining at a breakfast. The hostess provides upon slips of paper,
what may be termed cake-conundrums. These are neatly written and wound
upon coarse steel knitting needles into little rolls and tied with
baby-ribbon to match the color scheme of the table.</p>

<p>These are brought in just after serving the coffee and passed to the
guests. The hostess announces that each is to guess the name of the cake
suggested on her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> slip; adding, the one who gives the most correct
answers wins the prize of a delicious cake. This should be exhibited.
The hostess has a list of the answers, and when one misses the "hit,"
she reads it aloud to the merriment of the crowd. For instance, one slip
reads: Name the President's cake. The answer is (Election). The
parenthesis must not appear on the slips. A list recently used, and very
wittily selected, is given for suggestion:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Oysters in Potato Balls</span>.</h3>

<p>Cook the potatoes the day before. While hot mash them, season nicely
with salt, paprika and a little celery salt. Add a generous lump of
butter, and one or two lightly beaten eggs. Form into little balls with
the hands floured. The next morning scoop out a hollow large enough to
hold two or three nicely seasoned oysters, press over the part removed,
egg and bread-crumb, and fry in a wire basket in deep hot fat. Drain a
minute on unglazed paper, and serve at once.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Rice Muffins</span>.</h3>

<p>Sift together half a teaspoonful of salt, a heaping teaspoonful of
baking powder, and two cupfuls of flour. Add two well-beaten eggs to one
cupful of sweet milk, and stir into the flour, with one teaspoonful of
melted butter and one cupful of dry boiled rice. Beat thoroughly, and
bake in buttered pans for thirty-five minutes. Serve with maple syrup.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Turkey Salad</span>.</h3>

<p>Cut the cold turkey meat into dice and mix it with twice the quantity of
diced celery and one cupful of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> broken walnut meats. Mix all well
together and moisten with a good boiled dressing. Serve in a nest of
bleached lettuce.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cheese Balls</span>.</h3>

<p>Roll rich pastry out very thin, cut it into circles with a small
tumbler, put two teaspoonfuls of grated cheese in the center of each,
add a dash of cayenne and a teaspoonful of finely chopped walnut meats,
then draw the edges of the paste together over the cheese, pinching it
well to form a little ball. Bake in a hot oven to a very pale brown.
Before serving reheat in the oven.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Strawberry Trifle</span>.</h3>

<p>Cut one large stale sponge cake in horizontal slices the whole length of
the loaf. They should be half an inch thick. Beat the whites of four
eggs to a stiff snow, divide it into two portions; into one stir two
level tablespoons of powdered sugar and one-half of a grated cocoanut;
into the other stir the same amount of powdered sugar and one-half pound
of sweet almonds blanched and pounded. Spread the slices of cake with
these mixtures, half with the cocoanut and half with the almond, and
replace them in their original form. The top crust should be cut off
before slicing the cake as it is used for a lid. Hold the sliced cake
firmly together and with a sharp knife cut down deep enough to leave
only an inch at the bottom, and take out the center, leaving walls only
one inch thick. Soak the part removed in a bowl with one cupful of rich
custard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> flavored with lemon. Rub it to a smooth batter, then whip into
it one cupful of cream which has been whipped to a dry stiff froth. Fill
the cavity of the cake with alternate layers of this mixture and very
rich preserved strawberries. Then put on the lid and ice with a frosting
made with the whites of three eggs, one heaping cupful of powdered sugar
and the juice of one lemon. Spread it smoothly over the sides and top of
the cake, and keep in a very cold place until time to serve. Then place
it on a silver or crystal dish, and put alternate spoonfuls of the
whipped cream mixture and preserved strawberries around the base.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Meringues Filled with Preserved Walnuts</span>.</h3>

<p>Beat the whites of six eggs to a stiff firm snow, stir into it
three-fourths of a pound of powdered sugar, flavor with a little lemon
or rose water, and continue to beat until very light. Then drop them
from a spoon, a little more than an inch apart, on well buttered paper,
keeping them as nearly egg-shaped as possible. Place the paper on a
half-inch board and bake in a slow oven until well dried out. Remove
from the paper, scrape out the soft part from the underside, and before
serving fill with preserved walnuts and stick each two together. The
preserved walnuts are a very delicious sweet but one rarely met with.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Cuban Breakfast</span>.</h3>

<p>The palm, of course, is the key note for decoration, as it is the
characteristic plant of the tropics. But in order to be true to the
scheme in mind, that is, to make your surroundings appear truly southern
and create a local atmosphere, a marked difference should be made
between the arrangement of our usual American interior and the room
which aims at the imitation of a Cuban home. Light and air are most
important, the factors <i>sine qua non</i>, and the scene of the <i>Almuerzo</i>
(breakfast) should not recall the hot house, the conservatory, nor the
dimly lighted, heavily curtained apartment of our northern dwellings.
There should be space, plenty of windows, the fewest possible hangings,
and these light in weight and color.</p>

<p>For the mantel and table decorations dwarf palms are very effective,
while larger ones of many varieties are appropriate for corners and
other available places. Very pretty souvenirs can be made of small palm
leaf fans. A Cuban landscape and the name of a guest are painted
thereon, and tiny Cuban and American flags tied on the handle make a
neat finish.</p>

<p>As most of the dishes served will be new to the guests, it is advisable
to have at each place a menu card where they may see how the dishes are
called, that they may not only relish them knowingly but remember their
excellence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>The hour for breakfast is noon, although it may be taken as late as one
o'clock.</p>

<p>Here is a typical breakfast which can be easily reproduced with the
material at our command.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Almuerzo</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Olives</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Aeles Sausage</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Eggs in Revoltillo</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Boiled Rice</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Fried Plantains</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Fish in Escabeche</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>New Potatoes</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Tenderloin Steak</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Lettuce Salad</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Guava Paste and Fresh Cheese</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Cocoanut Desert</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Fruit</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Coffee</i></p>

<p>The olives should be served with cracked ice; the Aeles sausage
(imported) in very thin slices.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Eggs in Revoltillo</span>.</h3>

<p>Fry in a little butter a good sized onion chopped fine; when brown, add
three fresh tomatoes and one sweet green pepper cut into small bits.
Salt to taste and let simmer until the tomatoes are quite cooked, then
add six eggs which have been beaten. Stir while cooking and serve soft
as you would scrambled eggs.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Rice</span>.</h3>

<p>Rice in Cuba is an indispensable article of food, and no meal is
complete without it. There is no little art required in its preparation,
and it is imperative that it should be dry and tender at once. Like most
simple things, it has a certain knack to it. Having thoroughly washed
the rice, place it in a saucepan with three or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> four times the same
quantity of water; salt generously and allow to boil until the grain is
soft but not broken; drain off carefully all the water, cover the
saucepan tightly and place at the back of the stove, where it will
finish cooking slowly and become dry through the action of the steam. A
small piece of lard added a few moments before serving glazes the rice
and brings out its flavor. Each grain should stand apart from its
neighbors. Some Cubans add a single kernel of garlic after removing the
water. The quantity is so small that there is but a suspicion of a
taste, and it gives this frugal dish a certain <i>cachet</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Plantains</span></h3>

<p>are essential to every breakfast in the tropics, but they are not always
obtainable here. A very good substitute is the ordinary banana. It
should not be over ripe. Fry until a rich brown in hot fat. These three
dishes should be served at one course.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Fish in Escabeche</span>.</h3>

<p>Take three pounds of bonito or halibut in slices, fry and lay for
several hours in a sauce made of half a pint of vinegar, in which the
following ingredients have boiled for a few minutes: Three or four
cloves, a bay leaf, a pinch of thyme, a kernel of garlic, a sliced
onion, half a teaspoonful of coloring pepper, three tablespoonfuls of
good salad oil and a few capers, olives and pickles. Hard boiled eggs
may also be used for garnishing. It is eaten cold, and will keep, well
covered in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> a stone jar, for weeks. (This dish is invaluable in summer.)
Serve with new potatoes, boiled, over which a lump of butter and a
tablespoonful of finely chopped parsley have been placed.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tenderloin Steak</span>.</h3>

<p>The best restaurants in Habana prepare the steak as follows: Take a
tender filet of beef, cut in cross sections an inch and a half thick,
wrap each piece in greased paper, and broil over a brisk fire. Remove
the papers, add butter, salt, pepper and plenty of lemon juice&mdash;say the
juice of two lemons for a whole filet. In Cuba they use the juice of the
sour orange, but that is not to be had here. This is the <i>creole</i> style,
and is simply a modification of the French way. If you want the steak <i>a
la espanola</i>, it should be fried instead of broiled, and when well done
each piece surmounted by a <i>mojo</i>. The <i>mojo</i> is a little mound
consisting of onions and green peppers chopped very fine, and lemon
juice added to the gravy.</p>

<p>Guava paste is easily obtained from any importer, and it is the proper
thing to eat it with fresh cream cheese or sliced Edam cheese.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cocoanut Dessert</span>.</h3>

<p>This is purely a tropical dish, but Americans are very fond of it. Peel
and grate a cocoanut; make a syrup out of four cups of sugar and two of
water; when the syrup begins to thicken (when it has boiled about five
minutes) throw in the grated cocoanut and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> cook on a moderate fire half
an hour more; stir in the beaten yolks of three eggs and a wine glass
full of sherry. Remove from the fire.</p>

<p>The final point of your breakfast is the coffee, and in Cuban eyes the
affair will be a success or a failure according to the quality of this
supreme nectar. The berry should be the best obtainable; freshly
roasted, or at least the flavor refreshened by heating the grain in the
oven a few minutes before using. Grind and percolate at the last moment.
Serve black and <i>very strong</i>, in very small cups.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Spring and Autumn Breakfasts</span>.</h3>

<p>The centerpiece is of moss and ferns with arbutus blossoms peeping out,
with a border of green and white fairy lamps mushroom form. Miniature
flower beds, marked off with tiny white shells are in each of the four
corners of the table. In one lilies of the valley stand upright,
narcissii are in another, white tulips in a third and white lilacs wired
on a tiny bush make the fourth. The name cards have tiny photographs of
a farm with the name of the guests in gilt script. At each place is a
tiny May basket of moss filled with arbutus, spring beauties, and wild
violets, for a souvenir. The ice cream in flower forms is brought in in
a spun sugar nest resting on twigs of pussy willows. The menu is a very
simple one and includes grape fruit, the center cut out and filled with
a lump of sugar soaked in rum, cream of clams, shredded whitefish in
shells with horseradish and cucumbers, filet of beef with mushrooms, new
potatoes, new asparagus, mint ice, squab on toast with shoestring
potatoes, current jelly; salad of cucumbers, pecan nuts and lettuce with
French dressing; ice cream, white cake, and black cake, coffee and cream
de menthe.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">April Breakfast</span>.</h3>

<p>April's lady wears the pussywillow for her flower, and this makes a
delightful springlike motif for decoration.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> For the breakfast have
round tables or one long table with twig baskets of pussywillows tied
with bows of soft grasses, raffia dyed a silvery grey. The table is set
with the old-fashioned willow pattern china, quaint Sheffield silver and
is unmarked by any of the small dishes of sweets that fill breakfast
tables. The name cards are decorated with sprays of pussywillows in the
upper left corner and miniatures of famous women writers of this and the
past decade taken from magazines: George Eliot, Miss Austen, Miss
Mulock, Jean Ingelow, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Felicia Hemans, Louisa
M. Alcott, Mrs. Humphrey Ward, Mrs. Burton Harrison, Mary E. Wilkins
Freeman, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, Margaret Deland.</p>

<p>The menu is strawberries in little twig baskets with brown paper caps
filled with sugar, planked fish with sliced cucumbers, deviled
sweetbreads and mushrooms on toast squares, Saratoga potatoes, hot
rolls, brandy peaches, waffles and hot syrup, coffee.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Maypole Breakfast</span>.</h3>

<p>This breakfast is given the last week in May and can be copied by the
summer hostess substituting different flowers in season. The guests are
seated at small tables, each table being decorated with a different kind
of flower&mdash;the iris, marguerites, sweet peas, roses, mignonette, etc.
Before each plate stands a tiny Maypole about the size of a lead pencil,
wound with baby ribbon of different colors. These are souvenirs for each
guest. For the first course have fresh strawberries served with their
leaves and blossoms. Then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> a cream of celery soup served in cups.
Croutons are served with this. The soft shell crabs are served on a bed
of water cress and radishes cut in fancy shapes. With them is served a
thick mayonnaise on half a lemon; and cucumbers with French dressing.
The brown and white bread sandwiches are cut in the shape of palm
leaves. Delicious orange sherbet is served in champagne glasses. Then
comes broiled chicken with new potatoes, French peas and hot rolls. The
fruit salad is served in head lettuce with square wafers accompanying.
The ice cream is molded in the form of red and white apples, with a
cluster of real apple blossoms laid on each plate. With this is served a
white cake with whipped cream and French coffee.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">May Breakfast</span>.</h3>

<p>Carry out the May basket idea for a breakfast. By searching the ten-cent
stores one can find little imitation cut glass baskets with handles. Use
a large cut glass basket or bowl with wire handle over the top for the
center of the table and one of the smaller baskets filled with pansies,
valley lilies or May flowers at each place. Or make a pretty crystal
wreath a short distance from the center by using crystal candlesticks
with white candles and shades of glass beads, alternated by the little
glass baskets filled with dainty flowers or maidenhair fern. Or use
these baskets for green, white or pink bonbons. Another pretty May
basket idea is to suspend little baskets of flowers from the back of
each chair and use an immense basket of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> flowers for the center of the
table. Suitable toasts for the name cards, which should be little flower
baskets cut out of water color paper and decorated, would be sentences
describing Mayday in various countries. Or, use sentiments of flowers.
Here are some:</p>

<p>The red rose: "I love you." The daisy: "There is no hope." Lily of the
valley: "My heart withers in secret." The lilac: "You are my first
love." Violets: "I am faithful." You will enjoy hunting for flower
sentiments.</p>

<p>For the menu serve: Tomato bisque, wafers; sweetbread croquettes, peas,
new potatoes, creamed asparagus, lemon sherbet; spring salad (radishes,
cucumbers, tomatoes, with French dressing on lettuce leaf),
strawberries, served with hulls on and around a paper cup or mound of
fine sugar; white cake with chocolate icing.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">An Autumn Breakfast</span>.</h3>

<p>If one loves the reigning color, brown, give a brown breakfast in which
all shades from seal to orange are used in pretty combination. A flat
wreath of brown foliage extends inside the plate line. In the center of
the table is a pyramid made of the tiny artificial oranges, buds and
blossoms that are shown in the milliners' windows. From this pyramid
radiate streamers of light brown tulle in wavy lines across the table to
the wreath at the edge. Yellow candles with autumn leaf shades in
yellows and browns are placed inside the space between the center and
the wreath.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> The name cards are placed inside little boxes decorated
with pyrographic work and suitable for jewel boxes. The creamed lobster
is served in cups covered with brown tissue paper, the browned chops,
browned fried potatoes, and browned rice croquettes are served on plates
decorated with a design of brown oak leaves and acorns. The ice cream is
chocolate frozen in shape of large English walnuts and the little
squares of white cake bear the design of a leaf in tiny chocolate
candies.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Musical Romance</span>.</h3>

<p>Have it for entertainment at breakfast with prizes for the one who
answers best. Each question is answered by the name of a song.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Red Rose Breakfast</span>.</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 26em;">"I find earth not gray, but rosy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 26em;">Heaven not grim, but fair of hue."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Here is a pretty breakfast for the month of June.</p>

<p>Have for the centerpiece a huge bowl of jacque-minot roses. Use long
sprays of the leaves and arrange the flowers very loosely in the bowl.</p>

<p>Have for the boutonnieres at each cover a bunch of red rose buds tied
with scarlet ribbon.</p>

<p>The place cards are also red roses cut to the required shape from rough
drawing paper and appropriately colored.</p>

<p>Of course the red touch will be introduced as frequently as possible
into the menu. Serve tomato soup, salmon salad and claret water ice.
Cakes must be glazed in red, and the ice cream, served in artistic
little baskets of spun sugar, to take the form of red roses.</p>

<p>Have side dishes filled with pink coated almonds and candied rose
petals.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, during the dessert course, introduce what is called a Rose Shower.</p>

<p>This will be on the order of the literary salads that were so popular
some time ago, but it is newer.</p>

<p>The idea is this: Cut from red tissue paper a couple of dozen little
leaf shaped pieces to be crimped and creased and coaxed into
representing rose petals. On each petal write a familiar quotation
relating to the rose.</p>

<p>These leaves are to be passed around the table, each guest taking one,
and when done with it, passing it on.</p>

<p>Prizes will be offered to the guests who are able to name the authors of
the largest number of quotations.</p>

<p>Here are some of the verses:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 24em;">That which we call a rose,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 24em;">By any other name would smell as sweet.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 24em;">But earthlier happy is the rose distilled</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 24em;">Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn</span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 42em;">&mdash;<i>Shakespeare</i>.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 24em;">The rose is fairest when 'tis budding new;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 24em;">And hope is brightest when it dawns from fears.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 24em;">The rose is sweetest washed with morning dew,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 24em;">And love is loveliest when embalmed in tears.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 42em;">&mdash;<i>Scott</i>.</span><br />

<p>These, of course, will be only about half enough, but the hostess can
add others to them.</p>

<p>The prize for the best list of answers should suggest roses in some way.</p>

lilies. For the souvenirs have very small oars which could afterwards be
used for paper knives; besides clusters of lilies.</p>

<p>Harp music is the most in harmony with our ideas of lilies and the lily
naiads, so the soft strains will form a delightful accompaniment to the
breakfast.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the menu:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Cream of Lettuce Soup</i></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cream of Lettuce Soup</span>.</h3>

<p>Break the outer green leaves from two heads of lettuce. Place neatly
together and with a sharp knife cut into shreds. Put them into one quart
of white stock and simmer gently for half an hour. Press through a
colander, return to the fire. Rub together one tablespoonful of butter
and two of flour, add two tablespoonfuls of hot stock and rub smooth,
add this to the soup, stirring constantly until it thickens. Add a level
tablespoonful of grated onion, one cupful of cream and a seasoning of
salt and white pepper.</p>

<p>When ready to serve, beat the yolk of one egg lightly, pour into a
tureen, turn the hot soup over it and add a heaping tablespoonful of
finely chopped parsley.</p>

<p>The fish is garnished with cress.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cheese Salad</span>.</h3>

<p>Mash very fine the cold yolks of three hard-boiled eggs, and rub with
them a coffee cupful of finely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> grated cheese, a teaspoonful of mustard,
a saltspoonful of salt and one-half as much white pepper. When all are
well mixed, add two tablespoonfuls each of oil and vinegar, alternately.
Heap this upon fresh lettuce and garnish with the whites of eggs cut
into rings, and a few tips of celery. Serve with hot buttered crackers.</p>

<p>The ice cream is served on lily leaves. The cakes are white, with green
icing.</p>

<p>This is the music selected:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Tulip Breakfast</span>.</h3>

<p>A pretty idea is a tulip breakfast. The centerpiece is a large basket
filled with tulips of different colors. A pretty course is strawberries
served in real tulips lying on fancy plates with the stems tied with
narrow ribbon the same shade as the tulip. The ice cream is served in
shape of a tulip, and the salad is in a cup of green tissue paper
imitating four tulip leaves. This is the plan for finding places. The
name cards are decorated with tiny landscapes. On the back of the card
is written the title of a song and the guest finds her own name in the
title. For example a guest named Mamie will find her place by the words
"Mamie, Come Kiss Your Honey Boy," one named Alice will find hers "Oh,
Don't You Remember Sweet Alice, Ben Bolt;" Mollie in "Do You Love Me,
Mollie Darling," etc. The menu is:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Grape Breakfast</span>.</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 21em;">May the juice of the grape enliven each soul,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 21em;">And good humor preside at the head of each bowl.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Nothing could be prettier nor more appropriate for September than a
grape breakfast. If possible, have the design of the lunch cloth in
grapes, and use a pyramid of purple and white grapes for the center of
the table. Lay perfect bunches of grapes tied with lavender ribbon on
the cloth for decoration. Serve grapes in some fashion with each course,
single, in tiny bunches, or the leaves decorating the plates. Mold
gelatine in a grape mold and color with grape juice. Use white grapes
for the salad and grape juice to drink. Serve grape jelly with the meat
course.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Woman's Club Breakfast</span>.</h3>

<p>Have the table of honor a round table with a large round basket of white
flowers and everything corresponding in white. Use roses, carnations or
any white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> flower you choose. Have oblong tables radiating from the
center table with place for four on each side and two at the outer ends.
This leaves no guest seated with her back to the honor table. Have the
oblong tables decorated in pink. Have name cards with carnations thrust
through the corner, at each plate. Make the breakfast a daylight affair,
unless the day is a dark one.</p>

<p>Serve chopped fresh sweet cherries sweetened and with a little rum or
white wine poured over them; let stand for several hours in the
refrigerator and serve in stem glasses. Chicken croquettes molded in
form of small chickens, or broiled chicken with water cress; creamed
potatoes, sliced cucumbers, hot rolls, spiced peaches served in
champagne glasses; whole tomatoes stuffed with cooked cauliflower and
nuts set on branch of cherry or strawberry leaves; cheese sandwiches
made very thin; ice cream molded in form of strawberries, small cakes
frosted, (place half of a large strawberry on top of each piece of cake
before serving).</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Breakfast al Fresco</span>.</h3>

<p>A breakfast al fresco is just the thing to entertain a party of young
girls. Have the tables on the porch. At each plate have a cluster of
flowers answering a conundrum. Give each girl a card containing the
conundrum and ask her to find her place at the table by the flower
answering the questions. These questions will not be hard for a hostess
to arrange and will of course depend on the flowers she can secure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Here are a few sample ones given at a recent breakfast: Who will attend
our next entertainment? Phlox. What happened when Gladys lost her hat in
the lake? A yellow rose (a yell arose). What paper gives the most help
in decoration? Justicia (just tissue). What will the Far North do for
you? Freesia. For what hour were you invited? Four o'clock. What is the
handsomest woman in the world? American Beauty. Use pink and green for
the color scheme and add a little touch of these two colors to
everything served. Tie the skewers of the chops with pink and green
ribbons and have the ice cream one layer of pistachio and one of
strawberry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Modern "Five O'clock</span>."</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 26em;">"A cup she designates as mine</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 26em;">With motion of her dainty finger;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 26em;">The kettle boils&mdash;oh! drink divine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 26em;">In memory shall thy fragrance linger!"</span><br />
</p>

<p>Although indebted to England for the afternoon tea, it is a very
informal affair across the water. It doubtless originated in suburban
homes, where during the hunting and holiday seasons, large and merry
house-parties are entertained for weeks together. Returning late from
driving or field sports the tired guests require some light refreshment
before making their toilets for the evening dinner. The English hostess
very sensibly meets this claim upon her hospitality by serving tea and
biscuit in library or drawing-room.</p>

<p>From this small beginning comes the American "Five O'Clock," one of the
prettiest of all social functions, and still smiled upon by Dame Fashion
as a favorite method of entertaining. Decorative in character, it gives
opportunity to display the treasures of porcelain, glass, silver,
embroidered napery and all the lovely table-appointments that everywhere
delight the heart of woman. More exquisite than ever before are the
little tea-tables&mdash;a succession of crescent shaped shelves, rising one
above the other, two, three or four in number, as the taste inclines.
Upon these, resting on cobwebs of linen or lace, are placed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
priceless cups, tiny spoons, graceful caddy and all other articles
necessary to the service. The silver caddy is now a thing of sentiment
as well as use&mdash;one recently bestowed as a bridal gift bearing engraved
upon it this little verse:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 26em;">"We sit and sip&mdash;the time flies fast,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 26em;">My cup needs filling,&mdash;project clever!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 26em;">She comes and I grown bold at last</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 26em;">Say 'Darling, make my tea forever!'"</span><br />
</p>

<p>In the future of married life, how sweet this reminder of the past, when
all the days were golden in the light of love, youth and hope! Another
couplet pretty and suggestive is found in</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 26em;">"A cup and a welcome for everyone,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 26em;">And a corner for you and me."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Amid flowers and softly shaded lights sits the gracious woman who pours
the liquid gold into the fragile cups, dispensing meanwhile, smiles and
the bright charming small talk that is so necessary to the success of
these occasions. A wise hostess selects for this important position the
most brilliant, tactful woman within her circle of friends. The menu,
although by no means regulated on the English house-party plan, should
consist of trifles&mdash;sandwiches, wafers, fancy cakes, ices, and possibly
a salad. Foreigners understand the value of the simple feast which makes
frequent entertaining possible and a delight rather than a burden. In
America the menu, decorations, etc., grow more and more elaborate from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
the ambition of each successive hostess to out-do her neighbor, until
the economy and beauty of simplicity is irretrievably lost in the
greater expense, fatigue and crush of a more pretentious function.</p>

<p>At the afternoon tea guests may come and go in street toilet, with or
without a carriage in accordance with preference and pocketbook. However
elegant the appointments and surroundings of this special function, the
progressive hostess must remember that her culture will be judged by the
quality of the beverage she serves. It is an age of luxury and refined
taste in palate, as in other things, and <i>tea</i> is no longer <span class="smcap">tea</span>, unless
of a high grade and properly brewed. The woman who trusts her domestic
affairs to a housekeeper, or in the event of attending to them herself,
depends wholly for the excellence of an article upon the price she pays,
is a very mistaken one. Without informing herself she may very naturally
conclude that Russian or Caravan tea is cultivated, buds and blossoms in
the land of the Czar, until later on, when her ignorance meets a
downfall in some very embarrassing way.</p>

<p>The high-class, fancy teas of China are prepared by special manipulation
and for the use of wealthy families in the Celestial Empire and are
therefore never exported to other countries. Russian tea-merchants,
recognizing this, send shrewd buyers across the desert into China just
at the season to secure the choicest pickings for future consumption by
the nobility of their own country. Of late years the "Five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> O'Clocks"
and consequent craze for fine teas in America has tempted them to obtain
a small quantity above the requirements of their titled patrons in
Russia and this they export to the United States. If genuine, the name
Russia or Caravan tea signifies the choicest and most expensive grade
procurable the world over. It will be remembered that among the many
gifts bestowed when in this country by its recent guest, Li Hung Chang,
were beautifully ornamented boxes and packages of this delicately
flavored and fragrant tea. The high class grades from India and Ceylon,
although not as costly as the Russian, may be used by the hostess of the
modern "Five O'Clock" without risk to her reputation as a woman of
culture. She will consent, however,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 28em;">"That tea boiled,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 28em;">Is tea spoiled,"</span><br />
</p>

<p>and avail herself of the pretty and convenient silver-ball, or the
closely covered pot or cups in which these rare teas should never brew
over three minutes. For the famous tea service of China and Japan, tiny
covered cups are always presented.</p>

<p>The American hostess will regret when too late, the many advantages of
the afternoon tea, alas! foolishly sacrificed upon the altar of her
vanity to excel in the extravagance of hospitality. Even now experience
teaches that "a tea" means anything from its original intention of
informal, pleasant social intercourse with light refreshments, to the
function which includes hundreds of guests, who are entertained at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> a
banquet presenting the most expensive achievements of florist and
caterer. In repudiation of this is the strict code of etiquette
requiring that "an invitation be worded to indicate truthfully the exact
character of the hospitality it extends. Courtesy to guests compels
this, that they may be able to conform in toilet to the occasion and
thus avoid the mortification of being under or over-dressed, the
<i>latter</i> to be counted as much the greater misfortune." This from a very
ancient book, it is true, but its lesson in good manners is none the
less pertinent now than when written in the dead past.</p>

<p>It remains with the hostess, whether one shall enjoy the pleasures and
privileges of the pretty Five O'Clock. Whether in the line of elegance
or simplicity, the tea Russian or Ceylon, it can be dainty, well served,
and lovely with flowers of sweet graciousness and cordial welcome. These
united may be depended upon to make it the social success coveted by
every woman who poses as a hostess, whether in cottage or palace!</p>

<p>Nowhere are the artistic instincts of a modern hostess more charmingly
brought to bear than in the appointments of her tea-table. To show
individuality in this cosy afternoon ceremony, is an aim not difficult
to reach.</p>

<p>The Russian table should have a cloth with insertion bands of the strong
Muscovite peasant lace that is brightened by red and blue threads in the
pattern; a tea caddy of niello work; and a brass samovar, of course.</p>

<p>Facilities for fitting out a Japanese tea-table can be found almost
everywhere. The "correct" outfit consists<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> of a low lacquered table,
lotus-blossom cups&mdash;with covers and without handles&mdash;and a plump little
teapot heated over an <i>hibachi</i> of glowing charcoal. It is not a
Japanese custom to have the tea-table covered, but the famous
embroiderers of Yokohama, having learned to cater to foreign tastes, now
send out tea-cloths of the sheerest linen lawn, with the national bamboo
richly worked in white linen floss above the broad hem-stitched hem.
These are exquisitely dainty in appearance, but can be easily and
successfully laundered&mdash;a very important consideration.</p>

<p>But the quaintest of all is the Dutch table, where the sugar basin is
supported over the heads of chased silver female figures; the cream jug
is in the form of a silver cow, and the beguiling Jamaica shows richly
dark through a Black Forest spirit bottle.</p>

<p>Cakes and wafers have lost favor at tea-tables. They have been replaced
by little savories, which harmonize with the popular antique silver and
china, by passing under their old-fashioned name of "whets;" for the
afternoon tea, originally intended to be a light refreshment, had become
a detriment to the dinner. Savories, on the contrary, are a whet to the
appetite and clear the palate for the due appreciation of the dinner.
Two or three different kinds are usually served. Anybody possessed of a
little cooking knowledge can arrange a variety of them at a minimum of
trouble and expense, and in their variety lies half their charm.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of fish, both preserved in oil and smoked, that may
be used. These should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> sprinkled with chopped <i>fines herbes</i>, placed
upon thin slices of fresh bread&mdash;from which the crust has been carefully
cut&mdash;rolled and served "<i>en pyramide</i>."</p>

<p>Toasted crumpets, heavily buttered, spread with <i>caviar</i> upon which a
little lemon juice has been squeezed and served hot, are considered a
great delicacy at English tea-tables. Another way of serving <i>caviar</i> is
to spread it on thin bread and butter, which is then rolled up like tiny
cigars. Russians declare, however, that the less done to <i>caviar</i> the
better it will be, and to send it to the tea-table in its original jar,
with an accompaniment of fresh dry toast and quartered lemon, is the
fashion preferred by connoisseurs.</p>

<p>It takes a grand dame, so to speak, to give a tea. The vulgarian almost
always overdoes it. She gets things to eat, while the woman who knows
gets people, and doesn't care what they have to eat. There is nothing
about a whole shop of provisions, while people who dress well, look
well, talk well and behave well, make up that charming circle called
Society.</p>

<p>The tea table may be green and white. Palms, ferns, mignonette, mosses
and clusters of leaves lend themselves to the nicest effects against the
whites of the table-cloth and china. If color is preferred, there are
tulips and daffodils of gorgeous beauty, and good for a week's wear.</p>

<p>Nothing but white damask is used by gentlewomen. The woman who gives a
tea never pours it. There are other things she can do to please her
callers. Tea is usually served with candlelight, and to be a success<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
need cost next to nothing, for nothing need be served that is
substantial enough to dislocate the appetite for dinner. Some women
serve an old fashioned beat biscuit, about the size of an English
walnut, with the cup of tea. These biscuits are awfully good, but only
the old mammies who have survived the War know how to make them, and
there is where the old families have the advantage of the new people.
Others serve brown sandwiches made of Boston brown bread and butter.</p>

<p>More slices of lemon than cream jugs are used. Cream is something of a
nuisance, and if people don't take lemon they can take tea as Li Hung
Chang does. For a guest to have a preference and emphasize it, is
downright rude. To be asked to a lady's house is glory enough for any
one. The grumbler can go to a restaurant and take a cup and drink it up
for a dime.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">An Afternoon Tea</span>.</h3>

<p>Send out the invitation for an afternoon tea a week or ten days or even
two weeks beforehand. Use visiting cards and below the name or in the
lower left corner, the hours: 2 to 6, or any hours one chooses. On the
top of the card or below the name write the name of the guest for whom
the tea is given, if it is an affair in honor of some guest.</p>

<p>Decorate the rooms simply or elaborately as one chooses. For a small tea
simply fill the vases with flowers, and make a special feature of the
tea table in the dining room. Have a center basket of flowers and ferns
tied with satin ribbons on the handle, or have cut glass vases at the
corners. Use lighted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> candles, white, or the color of your flowers, if
carrying out a certain color scheme in the dining-room. Pink, red or
yellow are liked for this room as they are warm, bright colors. If the
tea is given in spring or summer, green and white are liked. Have
candles and shades match the color scheme and place silk or satin of the
color used under the mats and doilies. On the table have cut glass or
fine china dishes filled with candies, chocolates, salted nuts and
candied fruits. Tea may be served from one end of the table and an ice
from the other. Have a friend pour tea. Place before her the small cups,
saucers, spoons. She fills the cups and hands them to the guests or to
those assisting in the dining-room. The cream, sugar or slices of lemon
are passed by assistants. Piles of plates are on the table by the one
serving ice. The ice is served into a cut glass cup and placed on the
plate with a spoon. Cakes are passed; so are the bonbons. Serve tea and
chocolate or coffee. If one wish a more elaborate collation, pass
assorted sandwiches, which are on plates on the table, or have a plate
containing chicken salad on a lettuce leaf, olives and wafers. Waiters
are best when the refreshments include two or three courses. The ices
may be brought in or served from the table and the coffee and tea served
from the table.</p>

<p>Ask from five to ten friends to assist in the parlors, to see that
guests go to the dining-room and that strangers are introduced. Stand at
the entrance or before a bank of palms in a window or corner and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> greet
the guests. The guest or guests of honor stand with the hostess and she
introduces them. A great many ladies do not wear gloves when receiving,
but it is proper to wear them. It would seem that the hands would keep
in better condition to shake hands with guests, if gloves were worn.</p>

<p>Bank the mantels with ferns and flowers and cover the lights with pretty
shades of tissue paper. Use pink or green and white in the parlors and
red, yellow or pink in the dining-room. Serve a fruit punch from a table
covered with a white cloth and trimmed with smilax, ferns and flowers.
Use a large punch bowl and glass cups. Have a square block of ice in the
bowl. If a cut-glass punch bowl is used, care should be used lest the
ice crack it. Temper the bowl by putting in cold water and adding a few
bits of ice at a time until it is chilled. Do not put ice into a warm
bowl or one that has not been thus tempered.</p>

<p>If there is music have a string orchestra concealed behind palms in a
corner of the hall or dining-room.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Telling Fortunes by Teagrounds</span>.</h3>

<p>First, the one whose fortune is to be told should drink a little of the
tea while it is hot, and then turn out the rest, being careful not to
turn out the grounds in doing so, and also not to look at them, as it is
bad luck.</p>

<p>Then she must turn the cup over, so that no water remains, for drops of
water in the teagrounds signify tears.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>Next, she must turn the cup around slowly toward her three times,
wishing the wish of her heart as she turns it.</p>

<p>After this she must rest it a minute against the edge of a saucer&mdash;to
court luck.</p>

<p>Then the fortune-teller takes it and reads the fortune.</p>

<p>Three small dots in a row stand for the wish. If near the top it will
soon be realized. If at the bottom some time will elapse.</p>

<p>If the grounds are bunched together it signifies that all will be well
with the fortune-seeker, but if they are scattered it means much the
reverse.</p>

<p>A small speck near the top is a letter. A large speck, a photograph, or
present of some kind, either one depending on the shape of the speck.</p>

<p>The sticks are people&mdash;light or dark, short or tall, according to their
color and length. A small one means a child. A thick one, a woman.</p>

<p>If they lie crosswise they are enemies. If straight up, intimate
friends, or pleasant acquaintances to be made.</p>

<p>If a large speck is near them, it means they are coming for a visit,
bringing a valise or trunk.</p>

<p>If there is a bottle shape near a stick it means a physician. If a book
shape, a minister or lawyer. If many fine specks, a married man.</p>

<p>The sticks with a bunch of grounds on their backs are bearers of bad
news, or they will "say things" about you.</p>

<p>A long line of grounds with no openings between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> foretells a journey by
water. If openings, by rail.</p>

<p>A large ring, closed, means an offer of marriage to an unmarried woman.
To a married one, it means a fortunate undertaking. To a man, success in
business.</p>

<p>A small ring is an invitation.</p>

<p>Dust-like grounds bunched together at the bottom or side are a sum of
money.</p>

<p>A triangle signifies good luck, so does an anchor or a horseshoe.</p>

<p>A half moon or star to married people means a paying investment. To
unmarried, a new lover or sweetheart.</p>

<p>A pyramid is extremely lucky.</p>

<p>A square or oblong, new lands.</p>

<p>Flowers, a present.</p>

<p>Leaves, sickness and death.</p>

<p>Fruit of any kind, health.</p>

<p>A hand, warning, if the fingers are spread. If closed, an offer of
friendship or marriage.</p>

<p>A cross signifies trouble. Any musical instrument, a wedding. Bird, suit
at law. Cat, deception. Dog, faithful friend. Horse, important news.
Snake, an enemy. Turtle, long life. Rabbit, luck. House, offer of
marriage, or a removal. Flag, some surprise or a journey to another
country.</p>

<p>A heart is the most propitious sign of all, as it means happiness,
fidelity, long life, health and wealth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Scotch Tea</span>. 1.</h3>

<p>To give an odd function that is not a complete fizzle is a fine art.
Easy enough it is for the hostess to plan an out-of-the-ordinary affair,
but to have the party turn out a success is, as the Kiplingites are
eternally quoted as saying, "quite another story."</p>

<p>For music have the Highlander's bag-pipe, the door opened by a man in
the striking garb of Scotland. For decoration use white heather and
primroses.</p>

<p>In the dining-room have the words "We'll take a cup o' kindness yet" in
large letters and conspicuously framed in pine. Presiding at the table
have young girls in Scottish costume who dispense the "cup o' kindness"
from a silver teapot nestling-in a "cosey"; (a padded cloth cover) to
keep hot the favorite feminine beverage.</p>

<p>The delectable dishes dear to the Highlander's heart are passed for the
approval of feminine palates. These viands include scones, a sort of
muffin made with flour, soda, sugar and water. These are split and
filled with orange marmalade straight from Dundee and, as everybody
knows, the best in the whole culinary world. Scones are baked on
griddles, and are especially popular in the country houses of Scotland.</p>

<p>Then there is a rich pastry called shortbread, made of butter, sugar and
flour&mdash;no water&mdash;and beaten up; rolled out about an inch thick and baked
in sheets.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> Shortbread is a great delicacy in Scotland. There are oat
cakes also, a biscuit made of oatmeal, shortening and water. Two kinds
of cake&mdash;black fruit cake and sultana cake, which is a pound cake
containing sultana raisins&mdash;complete the course of Highland dainties.</p>

<p>On the walls drape the striking plaids of Scotland, worked with the
names of the different clans.</p>

<p>In the reception-room have the words, "a wee drappie," framed in pine.
The inscription should be over a table on which is served mulled wine
from a silver pitcher kept in hot water. Even a white-ribboner would
call mulled claret delicious or get a black mark from the recording
angel for prevarication.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 26em;">"Better lo'ed ye canna be,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 26em;">Will ye no come back again."</span><br />
</p>

<p>makes a last pleasing inscription over the entrance for the departing
guest.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Scotch Tea</span>. 2. <span class="smcap">Followed by Supper</span>.</h3>

<p>A Scotch day, modeled after a genuine party in "Bonnie Scotland," is a
pleasing idea for the entertainment of a Lenten house party. From twelve
to twenty-four guests are entertained, the ladies being asked to come at
three o'clock and the gentlemen at half past six. As every woman, no
matter what her condition in life, works industriously knitting or
crocheting lace or embroidering, each guest brings her bit of handwork
and the afternoon is spent in chatting while fair fingers ply the
needles. At five o'clock the guests are invited to the dining-room where
they are seated at a large table.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>At a typical Scotch tea the centerpiece is an oblong piece of satin in
any preferred color edged with a ruffle of white lace. In the center of
this is a tall vase holding a miscellaneous bouquet, and at the corners
of the centerpiece are small vases of similar design holding similar
bouquets. All edibles are on the table at once, there is no removing of
courses. The teacups, silver teapot with satin cosey, silver or china
hot water pitcher and sugar and cream are placed in front of the
hostess. The hostess asks the taste of the guest as to sugar and cream
and fixes the tea herself. The maid passes the tea and then retires, and
the service becomes informal, the guests assisting. At each place is a
small tea plate, knife and spoon, but no napkins and none of the
numberless dishes generally seen on American tables. No water glasses
are placed on the table. Instead there is a pitcher, carafe or siphon on
the side-board or serving table, which is passed to the guest should he
ask for water. The table is nicely balanced by dishes in pairs, there
are two plates of butter, one fresh and one salted at either end of the
table, two plates of bread, two plates of fancy cakes, two dishes of of
bread, two plates of fancy cakes, two dishes of jelly, etc. The menu for
the tea is white and graham bread and fresh and salted butter, tea,
scones, strawberry jam, orange marmalade, fancy cakes, including
macaroons, jelly cake made in two layers and called jelly sandwiches and
sometimes tiny cold pancakes. The last course is fresh strawberries
served on the stem with powdered sugar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>The men arrive at half past six o'clock and are served tea in the
library, smoking room or den. Preceding the supper which is served at
half past nine o'clock, the guests talk, play cards or have music. The
supper table is arranged much as the tea-table save between the small
vases are small candleholders with lighted candles. The host and hostess
are at either end of the table and each serves a meat, the plates being
passed by a maid and by the guests. There is a vegetable dish at each
end of the table. The meats and vegetables are served on one plate, the
only extra plate being the small bread and butter plate with the bread
and butter knife laid across it.</p>

<p>The maid removes the first course dishes and places a large bowl of
strawberries and dessert saucers before the hostess who serves
strawberries, the maid and the guests passing the saucers. The guests
hand the nuts, cheese, fresh fruits and other edibles about, doing away
with the services of the maid.</p>

<p>The supper menu includes a hot beef-steak and onion or other meat pie,
cut by the hostess, hot fish, Finnan Haddie being a great favorite, cold
tongue, mashed potatoes, cauliflower, celery, cheese, bottled pop,
lemonade, white bread, graham bread, scones, fresh and salted butter,
jellies and jams, marmalade. The second course is fresh strawberries,
oranges, bananas, English walnuts.</p>

<p>After supper cards, music and chatting fill in the hours until midnight
and sometimes longer for the bonnie Scots are typical night owls.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Gypsy Tea Out of Doors</span>.</h3>

<p>A Gypsy tea is the occasion of entertainment of young men by young
women, wherein the young men have nothing to do but come and be treated
just as hospitably and courteously as is possible. The girls must do all
the hard work, all the planning, all the inviting and bear all the
responsibilities of every kind. Twelve or more girls meet and appoint
committees to attend to the necessary arrangements&mdash;one committee to
select a picnic ground, another to invite the young gentlemen whom they
desire to attend, another to arrange for the music, and another to get
the refreshments. All the other committees work under the directions of
the committee on arrangements. A Gypsy tea always begins at twilight.
The girls who are to select the picnic ground must exercise much
judgment in deciding on a convenient and picturesque location, and as
dancing is always an attractive feature of such an outing, they should
see that there is a suitable pavilion nearby. Then there must be a spot
well adapted for a campfire, for a Gypsy tea would never be a success
without a campfire burning in the twilight. Other essentials are a
kettle and tripod. Three rough poles are made to form a tripod and the
kettle is suspended from the vertex of the angles or the crossing point
of the poles. Music, in which string instruments figure most
conspicuously, should be selected, as this lends itself best to the
weird effect which should be sought. Three or four pieces will generally
be sufficient and they may consist of a violin, guitar, banjo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> and snare
drum or the drum may be omitted if not convenient. The committee
appointed to gather the refreshments must have the assistance of all the
other women of the club, for its work is very arduous and necessitates
great care and precaution and good judgment. Each girl must subscribe
something to eat, and care should be taken that all the girls do not
contribute cakes, pies and pickles. Get plenty of cold meats, sandwiches
and you might have some nuts of some kind or sweet potatoes or raw eggs
or something to roast in the campfire. In a Gypsy tea the young women
must all go to the grounds by themselves, unattended by the men and the
men are to arrive in a body later; they have previously been informed of
the exact location and hour when they will be expected. The young women
should all wear Gypsy costumes and one must be a fortune teller or good
at pretending that she can tell fortunes. If suitable arrangements can
be made for their reaching the grounds without appearing too conspicuous
they may wear the Gypsy costumes as outer garments en route. Otherwise
each girl can slip on something easily divested, over the Gypsy dress
and remove it at the picnic grounds before the young men arrive, donning
it again before time to start home.</p>

<p>Arrangements should be made for a vehicle to make the round of all the
girl's homes on the day of the Gypsy tea to gather up the refreshments
and take them to the picnic ground previously selected.</p>

<p>On the day of the outing all the girls gather at an appointed place and
go together to the grounds by such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> means of transportation as they deem
best suited to the conditions. The vehicle containing the refreshments
and other needful appendages may follow.</p>

<p>On reaching the grounds the girls all get busy making the preparations
and getting everything in excellent condition for the arrival of the
boys. The tripods are arranged, the kettle is hung, the campfire is
built, and the grounds are made to look artistic.</p>

<p>When the men arrive just at the hour of sundown, everything is in
readiness. The fire is burning brightly, the fortune teller is at her
post, the kettle is steaming and the refreshments are spread on table
cloths laid on the grass. Then the tea is made and each man enjoys a
dainty but toothsome repast.</p>

<p>After tea the baskets and equipments are replaced in the wagon and the
grounds cleared. The remainder of the evening may be spent in dancing,
fortune telling and the like.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Japanese Tea</span>. 1.</h3>

<p>In Japan the hostess serves the tea from the table. There is a charcoal
burner over which the water is kept lukewarm, not hot. The tea is
powdered very fine. It is in the teapot or cups as the hostess chooses.
The water is poured over it and off quickly for the tea in the cup is
very weak and only straw-colored, not dark as we make it. It is drunk
without cream or sugar. With it are served tiny wafer-like sweet cakes
and dishes of bonbons are on the table, no nuts, just bonbons. Nothing
is on the table save the tea equipment, tiny cups and saucers and dishes
of sweets. As the water is only lukewarm one can easily have the five
o'clock teakettle on the table (though that is not Japanese). As fast as
the water boils pour into a pitcher and keep the kettle replenished,
pouring into the cups from the pitcher. Or have the maids bring the
water from the kitchen. In Japan the geisha girls are employed in the
public teahouses to entertain men visitors so "maids" will be a better
term by which to call the young girls who help you. If one wishes to
make their room Japanese, fill the vases with imitation peach or cherry
blossoms, hang Japanese lanterns in doorways and Japanese banners, which
can be made from paper napkins and bright red paper for a background.
The incense sticks are very inexpensive and any large department store
which deals in Japanese goods including the five and ten cent stores,
keep them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>Serve date sandwiches cut in shape of dominoes and dotted with currants,
or nut or any sandwiches desired cut in this shape and so decorated,
chocolate with whipped cream, strawberries arranged around a mound of
powdered sugar, a spray of strawberry leaves and blossoms laid on the
plate, or any fresh berries. Serve small cakes domino shape covered with
white icing, dotted with tiny chocolate candies representing the domino
spots. Or if one wishes to serve ice cream with the berries have it
moulded in a two quart can, then turned out on a round platter, making a
column of ice cream. Surround with fresh berries at the base with a few
large perfect berries on top.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Japanese Tea</span>. 2.</h3>

<p>Instead of using the orthodox square at home cards, write the
invitations on long, thin, narrow slips of paper, the lettering running
from the bottom to the top and from right to left; a few queer birds,
the suggestion of a lantern and a falling chrysanthemum splashed in
carelessly in sepia, are very effective touches. The cherry-blossoms are
used in decorating, which are simply little, round, white paper petals
with the edges dipped in red dye, fastened to boughs and put up
everywhere, as are also the fluffy chrysanthemums, dainty butterflies,
and a profusion of cheap little fans.</p>

<p>A huge Japanese umbrella hangs over the tea-table, at which four girls
dressed in kimonas preside, while two others are in the drawing room.</p>

<p>The kimonas, which are very easily made, are all different in color,
although a two-color scheme would,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> perhaps, be prettier&mdash;say white and
yellow, or white and mauve, with chrysanthemums to correspond.</p>

<p>The refreshments are, perhaps, the most novel part of the whole idea.
Instead of the conventional salads, ices, cakes, etc., the guests are
served with delicious tea, in the daintiest of Japanese cups, and hot
buttered baps. During the afternoon have selections from "The Geisha,"
"The Mandarin," "The Little Tycoon," and "The Mikado."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Japanese Tea</span>. 3.</h3>

<p>At a Japanese Tea, several small tables are used, set at intervals in
the room; these are generally presided over by the hostess and the
ladies who receive with her, each being furnished with a tea service.
They are laid in white damask or linen embroidered in a Japanese design,
the center is occupied by a circular mound of red blossoms which
symbolize the emblem of the Flowery Kingdom's flag, combining the
national colors also red and white.</p>

<p>In the middle of the mound, slightly elevated, there is placed a
"Jinriki-sha," which is the riding vehicle of Japan, a two-wheeled
affair resembling our modern dog-cart; it is drawn by a man in costume
and seated in it is a woman, also in costume, holding above her and
large enough to extend over the table, one of those grotesque paper
umbrellas, which are as much a part of that country as its rice and tea.
The edges of these are festooned with red and white flowers and hung
with the smaller sized, globe shaped lanterns that are used profusely
about the room also, for decorating and lights.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>Candelabra likewise is used, and it should be of that quaint looking
black material that is decidedly Oriental in appearance and is the
latest thing in such bric-a-brac. White tapers with red shades show off
to advantage above this dark fancifully wrought metal, shedding a softly
subdued radiance, at once pretty and restful to the eye.</p>

<p>The chrysanthemum, while not the national flower, is the imperial
favorite and best beloved bloom of the people, therefore it is the
proper one for decoration, united with potted plants, palms, vines, etc.
All hues and kinds may be combined in the general adornment of room or
rooms (the red and white being confined to the tables alone), for
twining, banking or bouquets, just as fancy dictates, and the
furnishings admit. The chrysanthemum, gorgeous in itself and lavishly
employed, makes a superb decoration, and if, for a background, the
walls, doors, windows, etc., are draped in Japanese tapestry goods, with
friezes of the flowers, the result will prove singularly striking and
beautiful.</p>

<p>Of course, Japanese china is used, and as to the things to eat there can
be offered thin sardine sandwiches, delicate wafers, fruits,
confections. This is merely a suggestion; individuals use their own
ideas, and at different places customs change. Ices served should be in
oblong squares with round red centers to represent the flag of Japan.
Souvenirs for guests, if any are given, ought to be small cups and
saucers of the genuine ware or fac-simile in candy, tied with red and
white ribbons.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Two Valentine Teas</span>.</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 21em;">Here's to a cup of tea. It holds intoxication great for me.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 22em;">I find it makes me want to dare</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 21em;">Do bold things right then and there;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 22em;">To steal a kiss from Phyllis fair, as she pours tea.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Pink is the color scheme; the invitations are written on rose-tinted
cardboard, cut heart-shape and adorned with floral love-knots. The
hostess can wear a pink gown and the rosy-hue effect is also carried out
in the dining-room decorations. On a blank space of the wall have two
hearts formed of pink carnations and smilax, and pierced by a gilded
arrow. Beneath, on a pink cardboard, lettered in gold, have this verse:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 24em;">"Love always looks for love again;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 24em;">If ever single it is twain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 24em;">And till it finds its counterpart</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 24em;">It bears about an aching heart."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The long table, covered with snowy cloth, has the valentine idea in
heart design used as much as possible in the decorations. The candles
are pink and the paper shades in the shape of roses; pink bonbons
bearing appropriate mottoes and tiny cakes covered with pink frosting,
are in heart-shaped dishes; around the dishes are garlands of green,
caught in a bow-knot with a narrow pink satin ribbon. In the center of
the table is a large heart-shaped cake, fringed with smilax and pink
roses, and on the top, pink figures numbered from one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> to sixteen.
Before the cake is cut, a silver tray holding corresponding numbers is
passed, with the explanation that one of the pieces contains a tiny gold
heart, and that the finder will surely succumb to Cupid's darts before
another year. In another piece is a dime which will bring the lucky
possessor success, wealth and happiness.</p>

<p>The place-cards consist of heart shaped booklets with the name of the
guest in gold, and an artistic sketch of Cupid equipped with bow and
arrow. On the leaves are the following conundrums:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What kind of a ship has two mates and no captain? (Courtship.)</p>

<p>What is the difference between a mouse and a young woman? (One
wishes to harm the cheese, the other to charm the he's.)</p></div>

<p>The souvenirs are square cards, on which are quaint pen sketches, and
rhymes, each peculiarly adapted to the one that receives it, and, of
course, more or less personal.</p>

<p>The ices are heart-shaped and the two maids who act as waitresses
represent the Queen of Hearts, attired in dresses bedecked with hearts,
and small crowns of hearts upon their heads.</p>

<p>Have a heart hung from the chandelier, the guests in turn being placed
about eight feet from it, then request them to hold the left hand over
one eye, raise the right arm even with the heart, and keeping it in that
position, walk rapidly straight ahead and hit it with a finger, striking
horizontally. It is declared easy to do until tried.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Valentine Tea</span>. 2.</h3>

<p>Here are some contests for a valentine tea. Call on each one for an
impromptu valentine. Award a book of rhymes for the best. Turn down the
lights and require each man to propose to his partner. Prepare red
cardboard hearts and write fortunes on them with baking powder and
water. Ask each guest to select a heart and hold it to the fire when the
writing will appear. Provide a fish pond with comic valentines. Provide
a long table, sheets of fancy paper, flowers, pictures, paste, scissors
and watercolors and ask each to make an original valentine. The game of
hearts, the auction of hearts and the auction of valentines are old but
excellent ways of amusing a company. For the auction of hearts the girls
are in a separate room and a clever auctioneer calls off their charms
and merits and knocks them down to the highest bidder, who does not know
who he has bought until all are sold. A fancy dress party, each girl
representing a valentine, is a delightful entertainment for the evening.
A small boy may be used for Cupid and blindfolded. He takes a man from
one side of the room and presents him to a girl on the other side of the
room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Grandmother's Tea Party</span>.</h3>

<p>One of the newest suggestions for an original hospitality is "A
Grandmother's Tea Party." If you have an "at home" day, as every busy
woman should, and you want to serve tea to your guests, offer it to them
as it was offered fifty years or more ago.</p>

<p>First of all, collect all of your antique table service. Every family
has some dear old treasures of the kind&mdash;tea cups, old linen, flower
vases, silver epergns, etc.</p>

<p>You probably have somewhere laid away a wonderful old damask cloth which
dates back at least half a century. Cover the table with this and
scatter over it a handful of carnations, allowing them to fall at
haphazard.</p>

<p>The centerpiece will be in the form of a huge cake placed on a high
glass dish. This confection might be resplendent in a design of blossoms
and turtle-doves carried out in variously tinted icings as the old-time
cakes so often were.</p>

<p>On either side of the cake dish are placed tall epergns&mdash;veritable
antique pieces built high with pyramids of fruit. Bonbons&mdash;they should
be called sugar plums in this connection&mdash;must be old-fashioned sweets
quaintly wrapped in fringed papers.</p>

<p>Often the tall glass lamps will also be procurable in a pattern of fifty
years ago.</p>

<p>This will produce a thoroughly charming little table<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> with a quaintness
and a touch of femininity that everyone will enjoy.</p>

<p>The woman who is looking for a new way to serve tea on her day at home
couldn't do better than to attempt this. It is easy to do; it costs
little, it is pretty; it is feminine.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">An April Fool Tea</span>.</h3>

<p>Send invitations asking your guests to dress as foolish as possible. The
hostesses costume can be combinations of several, as a decollete
corsage, short walking skirt, one high-heeled slipper and one bedroom
slipper, one side of her hair braided and hanging down and the other
piled up high and decorated with feathers from the duster. Or she can
dress as "Folly" with pointed black velvet bodice, white blouse, red and
yellow striped skirts, pointed cap and wear a small black masque
covering the upper part of the face, and carry a stick wound with red
and yellow ribbon with tiny bells fastened by ribbons. If you care to
take the trouble and the expense (though it need not be very great), you
can construct a maze or labyrinth by which the guests approach your
door. Make this of frames of wood covered with sheeting, newspapers or
heavy cartridge paper, and make as many turns in it as you choose. When
the front door is reached have it fly back and display the sign: "April
Fool. Try the back door." If you have a side entrance you can have a
similar sign and prolong the agony. Have a dummy hostess at the back
door and direct the guests to one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> or two wrong rooms before they reach
the right dressing room.</p>

<p>Have a masked person standing at the door of the parlor as hostess. When
the guest starts to shake hands, display the sign "April Fool, I am not
the hostess." Have two or three hostesses before the right one is
reached.</p>

<p>Have the room full of surprises in the way of decorations, cabbage heads
and vegetables for bouquets, tin lanterns for lights, a den for stuffed
animals and similar fakes.</p>

<p>No talking of any kind will be permitted for the first hour, though two
or three notebooks and pencils can be displayed for those who feel they
must express their thoughts. The examination of the "fool" costumes will
take place in deaf and dumb show. Give a bunch of onions tied with green
calico for the worst costume.</p>

<p>Ring a big dinner bell at six o'clock and arrange one or two childish
games to be played to fill in the time before tea or ask the guests to
represent some noted character in pantomime, the others to guess which
character is portrayed.</p>

<p>For the tea pass cards numbered from one to ten and have the guests call
for their supper by indicating four numbers&mdash;1, fork; 2, sandwich; 3,
plate; 4, pickle; 5, napkin; 6, glass of water; 7, cup of coffee; 8,
cake; 9, spoon; 10, ice cream.</p>

<p>For instance, a guest writing on his card 1, 3, 5, 6, would receive a
fork, plate, napkin and glass of water for his supper. Have several
waiters and put names<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> on the lists so that all the articles may be
brought in at once. After waiting until those who get articles of food
try to eat them, for of course, the sandwiches, cake, pickles and ice
cream must be "April Fool" ones made of sawdust, cotton and similar
substances. Serve real sandwiches, coffee, cake and ice cream.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Colonial Tea</span>.</h3>

<p>A delightful way to entertain six elderly lady friends would be to give
a Colonial tea. Word the invitations thus:</p>

<p>"My Dear Madame:&mdash;Ye distinguished Honor of your Presence is requested
Thursday, ye Second of October, from Three of ye Clock until ye early
Candlelight, at Four Hundred and Seven, Sheridan Road, ye City of &mdash;&mdash;,
ye State of &mdash;&mdash;, to meet your most Obedient and Humble Servant,
Mistress &mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>Light the rooms with candlelight and decorate with nosegays of garden
flowers and autumn leaves. Seat the guests at round tables. Have all the
viands on the table at once. Let the menu be cold turkey, pressed
chicken, cold tongue, tiny pocketbook rolls, jellies and preserves,
gelatines, pound cake and fruit cake, hot tea and chocolate. Decorate
the table with old-fashioned flowers in quaint vases. Women of that age
generally prefer to bring their own needlework and visit, so have a
brief program of old-fashioned music, or an interesting old-fashioned
story read.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Pretty Rose Tea</span>.</h3>

<p>One of the most beautiful "rose" teas can be given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> if one has a rose
garden. Hundreds of dozens of roses, white for the drawing-room, red for
the hall and library, yellow for the music room and pink for the dining
room can be used. The roses are placed in immense Oriental bowls on
polished table tops. The tea table has an immense basket of pink and
white roses in rare varieties and the surface of the table is covered
with a smilax mat bordered with pink roses and tiny electric light bulbs
looking like glow worms. The ice cream is in the shape of a pink cup
with green handles filled with fruit the whole being of ice cream and
very delicious. With this is served little pink cakes and candy roses
and chocolate with whipped cream.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Omber Shades of Rose</span>.</h3>

<p>A beautiful color effect can be secured for a tea by placing on a long
table a series of French baskets of roses shading from American beauty
to white. The basket at the lower end of the table is in the American
beauty shade, the next basket of roses of a lighter shade, the third a
deep pink, the fourth a pale pink and the fifth basket bride roses. Tied
to these baskets are ribbons in the omber shades of rose. The candles
between the baskets are the same shades as the different roses and the
electric lights of the chandelier are hooded in rose like shades of
varying hues.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Bouquet Tea</span>.</h3>

<p>Let the invitations read somewhat in this way: "Will you take tea with
us under the trees Tuesday<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> afternoon at five o'clock? Please wear a
bunch of roses. Hoping that we may have the pleasure of your company,
believe me,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 38em;">Sincerely yours,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 42em;">&mdash;&mdash;."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The piazza is the most natural place for the guests to assemble, and
after hats have been laid aside within doors, the four walls of the
house may be left behind, and on the shaded piazza, made charming with a
few bowls of roses, the Bouquet Game can be played, making a pleasant
beginning to the party. This game is most suitable for a gathering not
too large, as it somewhat taxes the memory. The guests are placed at one
side of the piazza in a long line and each is provided with a bouquet,
holding a few less flowers than there are guests, that is: If there are
fifteen guests, each should have a dozen flowers. Each person then takes
the name of a flower and as the hostess calls the roll each says slowly
and distinctly, "I am a pansy," "I am a rose," "a tulip," "a violet," as
the case may be. The hostess writes these names down so that she may
have them for reference. She may call the roll once again when this is
done to freshen memories, and then until the end of the game no one,
under any circumstances, may reveal her flower identity. Then one at a
time, beginning at the right hand, each guest is called to the center
facing the line to be asked one question by every one in turn in the
line. In her answers the one in the center must include the questioners'
flower identity. No. 1, for instance, is "Lily" and asks the person in
the center. "What animal do you like best?" He answers, "Tiger-lily" and
then Lily presents him with a flower. No.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> 2 may be "Sunflower" and the
one in the center cannot remember it, so when asked a question he says
to sunflower or No. 2, "Weed I know you not" and gives Sunflower a
flower, and so all down the line until the end when the one who has been
in the center takes his place in the line and the next in turn comes out
to the middle of the piazza to face the ranks and try his memory. Of
course many of the flower names can only be brought in awkwardly, but
there is a chance for some cleverness and fun.</p>

<p>The game makes merry fun if all enter into the spirit of it. If any one
gets entirely out of flowers he drops out of the game. At the end prizes
are given to the man and the girl having the largest number of flowers
in their bouquets.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Spring Planting</span>.</h3>

<p>Spring Planting is another good contest:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

</table></div>

<p>Then if the hostess has even a bit of a garden, a bell rung out under
the trees calls the merry throng to partake of old-fashioned "high tea"
at little tables set where the afternoon shadows slant restfully, and
with the birds' music about, the charm of out-of-doors will add flavor
to the dainties. Tea biscuit, chicken salad and tea or chocolate, ices
or frozen custard and sponge cake are most suitable.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A High Tea</span>.</h3>

<p>A High Tea is one of the most complimentary entertainments to which a
hostess may invite her friends in the afternoon. The number of guests is
limited, but the possibilities for decoration, daintiness and elegance
are unlimited. The exact hour is written on the invitation, as High Tea
at 4:00 o'clock (or 5:00 o'clock). The guests may number about
twenty-four, but twelve or sixteen is a desirable number. They arrive
exactly at the appointed hour. They are seated at small tables having
places for four at each table. The menu is a little more substantial
than for a reception. Here is a typical "High Tea" menu:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Hot Bouillon</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Sweetbread and Mushroom Patties</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Tiny Pickles</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Creamed Chicken in Green Peppers</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Cauliflower Scalloped</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Hot Rolls</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Spiced Cherries</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Asparagus Salad</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Grated Parmesan Cheese</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Ice Cream in form of Fruits, Flowers, or any desired form</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Angel Food</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Coffee</i></p>

<p>This menu, of course, may be varied. Clam cocktail, grape fruit, a fruit
cup or hot fruit soup may be served for the first course, croquettes,
any sort of salad and ice cream or gelatines.</p>

<p>An original embroidery contest to precede the tea is to secure the large
pattern initials which come very inexpensive, getting the initial of
each guest. Prepare oblong pieces of linen or lawn which will fold into
envelope shape, six by fourteen inches. Give each guest a piece of the
linen and the pattern for her initial. She embroiders the initial in the
corner or center of the flap to the "envelope" which is a stock and
turnover case when finished. Each guest is given her turnover case to
finish as a souvenir. Give prizes for the best initial, the one
completed first and for the slowest.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Simple Menu for High Tea</span>.</h3>

<p>For a high tea for ladies, serve first an oyster cocktail in glasses,
fruit punch or brandied peaches. Then serve sweetbread salad, with bread
and butter sandwiches. Frozen eggnog and fig cake are a change from the
regulation ice cream. Follow by tea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A "Book-Title" Tea</span>. 1.</h3>

<p>The latest novelty in afternoon entertainments in England is what is
called a "book-title" tea. Of course, this would be just as amusing in
the evening, and any refreshments may be served that the hostess
prefers.</p>

<p>The guests are all expected to devise and wear some particular badge or
ornament which indicates, more or less clearly, the title of some book,
preferably works which are well known.</p>

<p>The "badges" worn may be very clever and most tastefully executed.
"Dodo" may be impersonated by showing a bar of music containing the two
representative notes of the tonic sol-fa method. "Little Men" is
represented by a badge bearing the names of little great men, such as
Napoleon, Lord Roberts, etc.</p>

<p>A lady may wear around her neck fragments of china tied by a ribbon.
This represents "The Break-Up of China," Lord Charles Beresford's book.
Another lady, whose name is Alice, may wear a necklace of little
mirrors, and this represents "Alice Through A Looking Glass." An
ingenious design consists of a nickel coin, a photo of a donkey, another
nickel coin, and a little bee, meaning "Nickolas Nickleby." A daisy
stuck into a tiny miller's hat stands for "Daisy Miller," and the
letters of the word olive twisted on a wire for "Oliver Twist."</p>

<p>Two little gates, made of paste board and a jar, represents "Gates
Ajar," and a string of little dolls dressed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> as men, "All Sorts and
Conditions of Men." There are many other interesting and ingenious
designs.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Book Title Tea</span>. 2.</h3>

<p>This is an original entertainment for a few friends. Have amusing pen
and ink sketches handed around together with a small note book and
pencil for each guest. Explain that each sketch is supposed to represent
some well-known book and each guest is given an opportunity to put on
his or her thinking cap and name the volume in his note book and pass
the sketch on. This novel game affords no end of mirth and enjoyment and
at a given time the hostess looks over the books and corrects them.</p>

<p>The House of Seven Gables is very simple and easy to guess, it being
simply a rough sketch of a house with seven gables.</p>

<p>An Old-Fashioned Girl is represented by a girl of ye olden time in
simple and quaint costume with a school bag on her arm.</p>

<p>A small snow covered house is enough to suggest "Snow Bound" to many of
the guests.</p>

<p>The Lady and the Tiger ought not to puzzle anyone, it is a simple sketch
of a lady's head in one corner and a tiger in the other.</p>

<p>On one card appears 15th of March, which seems more baffling than all
the others. It proves to be "Middlemarch."</p>

<p>A large letter A in vivid red of course represents "A Scarlet Letter."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>"Helen's Babies" is a sketch of two chubby boys in night robes.</p>

<p>"Heavenly Twins" is represented by twin stars in the heavens.</p>

<p>"Darkest Africa" needs nothing but the face of a darkey boy with mouth
stretched from ear to ear.</p>

<p>One of the sketches is a moonlight scene with ships going in opposite
directions and is easily guessed to represent "Ships that Pass in the
Night."</p>

<p>Anyone with originality can devise many other amusing and more difficult
sketches. Prizes might be given to the one who guesses the largest
number correctly.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Patriotic Tea</span>.</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 23em;">"While other constellations sink and fade,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 23em;">And Orient planets cool with dying fires,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 23em;">Columbia's brilliant star can not be stayed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 23em;">And, heaven-drawn, towards higher arcs aspires;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 23em;">A Star of Destiny whose searching rays</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 23em;">Light all the firmament's remotest ways."</span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"That force which is largely responsible for the greatness and
grandeur of the Republic is the woman behind the man behind the
gun."</p></div>

<p>Booklets with small silk flags mounted on the covers and bearing these
quotations with tiny red, white and blue pencils attached make suitable
favors for the guests at a high tea. For one contest give twenty minutes
in which to write a list of words ending in "nation" as, carnation,
condemnation, etc. For this prize give a red, white and blue streamer on
which tiny flags of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> all nations are fastened. For a second contest
allow a given length of time in which to write correctly the words of
the American national anthem. A book containing a description of
national music would make a suitable prize for this contest. Decorate
the dining room with silk flags and red, white and blue bunting and in
the center of the table have a blue vase filled with red and white
hyacinths or carnations or roses. Have the ice cream frozen in form of a
bust of Washington on a shield in three colors.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Debut Tea</span>.</h3>

<p>The leading color in the refreshment room is yellow. The table has a
beautiful lace cover and in the center is a large basket of yellow
roses, the Golden Gate variety. Around the center are candles with
yellow silk shades and a silver compote holding green glace grapes tied
with yellow ribbon. The mantel is filled with ferns and a mass of yellow
roses in the center. The electric lights at either side of the mantel
have yellow silk shades. Instead of ice cream and cake, the menu for the
afternoon tea is a delicious meringue filled with whipped cream and wine
jelly, coffee and glace grapes.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Yellow Tea</span>.</h3>

<p>Yellow is a pretty color for a bridal tea given in June. Use scores of
yellow candles in crystal candlesticks and candelabra and yellow roses
in vases, baskets and wall pockets on window and book ledges, plate
rails, book cases and hung in the doorways by yellow ribbons. An<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
immense basket of yellow roses and ferns with a white cupid in the
center is pretty in the center of the tea-table. Outside this basket
have a border of individual crystal candlesticks with yellow tapers and
small golden hearts attached to the tapers. The bonbons are yellow
hearts and all the refreshments are yellow and heart shaped.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Candlelight Tea</span>.</h3>

<p>Illuminate the rooms with candles in different colors with shades to
correspond, green and white in the parlor, setting a row of candles in a
straight line across the mantel and banking them with masses of feathery
green. Use pink in the dining or supper room. Have a round table lighted
by pink candles and pink shades in flower forms, placing the candles
either in a pyramid in the center or in a wreath with Christmas green
tied with broad pink ribbon, in the center. At each plate put a tiny
Dresden candle stick (such as come in desk sets) with pink candles for
favors. Serve hot bouillon, oyster and mushroom patties, tiny pickles,
creamed chicken in green peppers, cauliflower au gratin, hot rolls,
spiced cherries, asparagus salad, grated Parmesan cheese, wafers, ice
cream in form of pink candles with lighted tapers, Christmas cakes.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Flower Tea</span>.</h3>

<p>For early September a flower tea is a most enjoyable affair and is
easily arranged with little expense. Have the invitations sent out at
least a week before the event.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>The parlors should be tastefully arranged and decorated with flowers.
Wild flowers are in abundance at this time and they are always bright
and cheery.</p>

<p>Let each guest, as she arrives, be presented with a bouquet of flowers,
no two being alike.</p>

<p>For amusement there is nothing better and more instructive than the
following:</p>

<p>Pass to each lady a sheet of paper with a pencil, the paper containing
typewritten questions. Explain to the company that the contest is to
last fifteen or twenty minutes as desired.</p>

<p>The printed questions are to be answered by the name of flowers.</p>

<p>Here are appropriate questions for the contest, with correct answers:</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align='left'>What lady veils her face? Maid-of-the-Mist.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Who is the sad lady? Ane-mone.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>What lady weeps for her love? Mourning-bride.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Who is the bell of the family? Bell-Flower.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>What untruthful lady shuns the land? False-Mermaid.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>What young lady is still the baby of the family? Virginia Creeper.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>What lady comes from the land where ladies bind their feet? Rose-of-China.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Who is the neat lady? Prim-rose.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>After the given time expires let each guest sign her name to the paper
she holds and exchange with her nearest neighbor. Then the fun begins as
one rises and reads the questions and answers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>Each lady should mark the paper she holds and in rotation they rise and
give the number of correct answers, not mentioning the name on the
paper. When it has been decided which paper holds the greatest number of
correct answers, the contestant's name is given as winner, and she is
presented with a dainty souvenir, such as a flower vase, or a dainty
painting of flowers. Other games and contests may follow, all suggestive
of flower land.</p>

<p>The afternoon-tea should be dainty and appropriate. A big doll,
literally covered with flowers, makes a pretty centerpiece for the
table. Let ice lemonade be served, each glass having a sweet flower
floating on its surface. The cakes should be in the form of flowers and
the bonbons, flower candies.</p>

<p>It is pretty to call each guest by the name of the flower given her when

<p>If there is music after tea let a song of the flowers be rendered.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">An Exchange Tea</span>.</h3>

<p>This style of party is intensely amusing, and will keep a large company
interested for several hours of an evening or afternoon, as it is one
continued round of mirth-provoking "sells," in which everybody is
"sold." It is not so much in vogue for small affairs, where only a few
guests are invited, but where a large crowd is to be entertained it is
just the thing to furnish enjoyment and fun.</p>

<p>This is how it is arranged. When requested to attend an exchange tea,
each person, male and female,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> picks out from his belongings, personal
or otherwise, such an article as he or she does not want, and after
wrapping it well, takes it to the party. Of course, everybody desires to
get rid of his parcel, and the exchange business waxes warm and furious
as it progresses, for usually not one individual obtains anything which
he wishes to keep, as a "pig in a poke" is scarcely ever a bargain.</p>

<p>Constant exchanging is not compulsory, so that if by any lucky chance
you have gotten rid of your own bundle, and become the proud possessor
of another whose hidden treasures happen to suit you, then you are
privileged to stop and hold on to your prize. Generally speaking,
however, the contents of the mysterious parcels are hardly ever
desirable, which creates all the more excitement and enthusiastic
bargaining, and in the end each one will be left with something
ridiculous or utterly useless, upon his hands.</p>

<p>And that's just where the fun comes in.</p>

<p>Serve this menu:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Cold Sliced Chicken, garnished with tiny Radishes and Hard-boiled Eggs</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Olives</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Nut Sandwiches</i></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Watermelon Tea</span>.</h3>

<p>Ask a congenial party, being sure that all are fond of watermelon. Have
the fruit on ice at least twenty-four hours before serving, and above
all things give this affair when the temperature is up in the nineties
if you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> want it fully appreciated. Have a sharp knife and cut the melons
at the table (for it is such a decorative fruit), and use only white
dishes and flowers. Let each guest count the seeds in the piece or
pieces and give a souvenir to the one having the largest number. A
pretty prize and appropriate is to procure a very small and symmetrical
melon, cut off the end, hollow out and line with oiled paper, fill with
bonbons and tie the end on with broad pink satin ribbon.</p>

<p>If expense is no object, have a quartet of colored singers with banjos
concealed and let them sing good old plantation songs for an hour or
two, not forgetting "Den, oh, dat watermelon." Grape juice is a good
drink to serve this party. Have the tumblers half filled with finely
cracked ice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Unique Ideas for Tea</span>.</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Chocolatiere</span>.</h3>

<p>A chocolatiere is a pretty affair. The decoration is an immense mound of
bride roses in the center of the dining room table. The refreshments are
baskets of chocolate ice cream filled with whipped cream. The cakes are
chocolate squares. The candies are all chocolate and cream, and hot
chocolate is served. Chocolatieres are very popular entertainments for
young girls and for matrons. They are given in the morning or afternoon.
As nearly every woman loves chocolate, they are pretty certain to please
the guests.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Kaffee Klatch</span>.</h3>

<p>The kaffee klatsch is an afternoon affair where ladies meet and chat as
they sew and are served a luncheon of German dishes&mdash;cold meats, salads,
coffee-cake, pickles, coffee, etc. Each guest is given a bit of
needlework, button-holes to work, or a small doily to embroider and a
prize is given for the best work.</p>

<p>Have a number of tea towels, cheesecloth dusters, Canton flannel bags
for brooms, silverware towels, etc., cut and ready to hem. When the
ladies assemble, let them hem these as a gift for the bride (for whom
the kaffee klatsch is given) to take home with her. Ask each to tell
some of her first experiences in housekeeping, and at the close of the
afternoon take a vote on the funniest experience, the cleverest in
emergency<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> and the best told. To do this successfully, you will have to
lead the conversation and not let the ladies know they are talking
purposely. Another way is to assign topics as for a conversation party,
giving such topics as: "My first attempt at making bread," "My first
housecleaning," "Unexpected guests," "My first pie," etc. Or, ask each
guest to write her first housekeeping experience (some funny incident)
and bring it. Have the papers read aloud, but not the names. Let the
guests guess whose the experiences are. Use this contest.</p>

<p>For a prize for the best answers give a little leather sewing case
fitted with needles and thread.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A "Rushing" Tea for Sorority</span>.</h3>

<p>Generally speaking, one will use their sorority colors in flowers and
ribbons and their insignia cut from paste-board and covered with tissue
paper of the desired color. A gigantic insignia would make a suitable
wall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> decoration. Hang pennants of the colors everywhere, and if it is a
musical sorority, work in the staff and notes in the decorations. These
can be painted on cheap white muslin or paper and tacked about the
walls. If one cares to learn a little musical yell, do so as a surprise.
If the "rushing" is for new members, one can easily plan a series of
funny tableaux picturing the new member in various incidents: Leaving
home, or Breaking Home Ties; Arriving at College; Crossing the Campus;
Meeting the President; Meeting Her Roommate; Unpacking, etc. Insist upon
the new members' answering each question to the tune of some college
song, or else coach the old members to answer all questions by new
members in this manner. Have a sorority of dolls dressed in the colors,
each doll holding a pennant, in the center of the table. Paint the staff
and notes on the muslin tablecloth and make little paper drums to hold
the salted nuts and bonbons. Serve grape juice, a salad of mixed fruits,
sweet wafers and chocolate.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sandwiches for Teas</span>.</h3>

<p>The first requisite in the preparation of good sandwiches is to have
perfect bread in suitable condition. Either white, brown or entire wheat
bread may be used, but it should be of close, even texture, and at least
one day old.</p>

<p>For very small, dainty sandwiches to be served at afternoon teas or
breakfasts, the bread may be baked at home in baking-powder tins. These
should be only half-filled, and allowed to rise before baking. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
butter should be softened by creaming, not melting, and spread smoothly
on the bread before it is cut. Cut the slices as thin as possible, and
when a variety is offered it is well to keep each kind of a different
shape, as, for instance, circles of anchovy, triangles of chicken,
fingers of game and squares of fruit butters.</p>

<p>Flavored butters are much used in making sandwiches, and are simply and
easily prepared. Fresh, unsalted butter should be used. After creaming
the butter, add the flavoring material, and beat until smooth and
thoroughly blended. Caviare, anchovy, sardines, oysters, salmon,
lobster, cheese, cress, chives, Chili, Chutney, olives, parsley,
cucumbers, horseradish and paprika are all used for flavoring these
various butters.</p>

<p>For afternoon teas, fruit and flower butters make delicious sandwiches.
Of these the most popular are strawberry, pineapple, red raspberry and
peach. Lemon butter mixed with fresh grated cocoanut is also a
delectable sandwich filling, and cherry jelly with shavings of dried
beef another. Butters flavored with rose or violet petals are very
delicate and attractive, but, as may easily be imagined, find little
favor with the sterner sex, who prefer their refreshments of a more
substantial order.</p>

<p>Anchovy Sandwiches&mdash;Rub the yolks of hard-boiled eggs to a paste, season
to taste with anchovy essence, and add a few olives, stoned and chopped
very fine. Spread this mixture on very thin slices of buttered bread and
cut into dainty shapes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>Caviare Sandwiches&mdash;Spread thinly-buttered bread with fresh caviare
seasoned with lemon juice and on top of this lay a little minced
lobster. Finish with another piece of buttered bread.</p>

<p>Olive Sandwiches&mdash;Scald and cool twelve large olives, stone them, and
chop very fine. Add one spoonful of mayonnaise dressing, and one
teaspoonful of cracker dust; mix well, and spread on buttered bread.</p>

<p>Queen Sandwiches&mdash;Mince finely two parts of cooked chicken or game to
one part of cooked tongue, and one part minced cooked mushrooms or
truffles. Add seasoning and a little lemon juice, and place between thin
slices of buttered bread.</p>

<p>Lobster Sandwiches&mdash;Pound two tablespoonfuls of lobster meat fine; add
one tablespoonful of the coral, dried and mashed smooth, a teaspoonful
of lemon juice, a dash of nutmeg, one-fourth of a teaspoonful of
paprika, and two tablespoonfuls of soft butter. Mix all to a smooth
paste and spread between thin bread and butter.</p>

<p>Jelly Sandwiches&mdash;Mix a cupful of quince jelly with half a cupful of
finely chopped hickory or pecan nuts, and spread on buttered bread.</p>

<p>Date Sandwiches&mdash;Wash, dry and stone the dates, mash them to a pulp, and
add an equal amount of finely chopped English walnut or pecan meats.
Moisten slightly with lemon juice. Spread smoothly on thinly-sliced
brown bread.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>Fig Sandwiches&mdash;Stem and chop very fine a sufficient number of figs. Add
enough water to make of the consistency of marmalade, and simmer to a
smooth paste. Flavor with a little lemon juice, and when cool spread on
thin slices of buttered bread, and sprinkle thickly with finely chopped
nuts.</p>

<p>Fruit Sandwiches&mdash;Cut equal quantities of fine fresh figs, raisins and
blanched almonds very small. Moisten with orange juice and spread on
white bread and butter.</p>

<p>Beef Sandwiches&mdash;To two parts of chopped lean, rare beef, add one part
of finely minced celery, salt, pepper, and a little made mustard. Place
on a lettuce leaf between thin slices of bread and butter.</p>

<p>Ginger and Orange Sandwiches&mdash;Soften Neufchatel cheese with a little
butter or rich cream. Spread on white bread, cut in very thin slices,
and cover with finely minced candied orange peel and preserved ginger.
Place over another slice of bread. Candied lemon peel and preserved
citron, finely minced, also make a delicious sandwich filling.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Novelties in Tea Serving</span>.</h3>

<p>If you wish to vary the serving of your tea add three cloves to the
lemon and sugar. Or a thin slice of apple added with sugar is delicious.
In Sweden a piece of stick cinnamon is added by some to tea while it is
steeping.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Summer Porch Tea Parties</span>.</h3>

<p>One of the prettiest decorations for a porch tea party is a hanger or
pocket for flowers made by cutting pockets in large round pieces of
bamboo, the rods being about three feet long. These pockets are filled
with scarlet lilies and hung in the corners and on the posts of the
porch. Hang Red Chinese lanterns in the open spaces and have red paper
fans in Chinese jars on tables and ledges. The porch boxes along the
railings can have their real contents almost concealed in ferns, and
scarlet lilies stuck in amid the ferns. Across one corner the gay
striped hammock, with its open meshes filled with wild cucumber and
clematis vines fastened against the house, makes a background for the
punch bowl. Orange ice and cream cake can be served on plates decorated
with gold and white, with a bunch of daisies tied with pale green gauze
ribbon on each plate.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Summer Porch Tea Party</span>. 2.</h3>

<p>A porch tea party given in the summer is a most enjoyable affair. The
guests are seated on the porch which has immense jardinieres filled with
garden flowers, and draperies of large American flags. The punchbowl is
just inside the door in the hall. The guests bring their needlework and
as they sew, one of the number reads a group of original stories.
Following this have a little contest called The Menu. The prize for the
correct list is a solid silver fork with a rose design. The refreshments
are lemon sherbet, macaroons, sweet wafers, pecans and bonbons.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>
